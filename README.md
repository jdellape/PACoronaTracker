# PACovid19Tracker

This is a simple python web scraping tool that collects statistical information related to the Covid-19 virus across Pennsylvania counties. I have found it difficult to find any time series analysis data at a level more granular than the state level. I am using this to take a daily summary each morning on the growth of confirmed covid-19 cases across Pennsylvania counties.

The web page currently being scraped is: https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx

I am posting daily results to this Google Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJ5hJgAr2xNChkcJha0rp8jZ1lZXh19H4d9jMCQNni4/edit?usp=sharing

A visualization of this data can now be found at my tableau public profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/john.dellape#!/vizhome/pa_covid19_cases_by_county_map/PACovid19ByCounty

# Next Steps
1. Continue to compile and post this information on a daily basis
2. Create helpful time series visualiations from the daily totals to provide better insight at a county by county level
3. Attempt to automate data collection and visualization processes

# Inspiration
The COVID Tracking Project has been collecting testing information across all states: https://covidtracking.com/. 
I am hopeful that this small project may contribute to better insight at a sub-state level in Pennsylvania.
